A game about beating the heart.<br />
Basic Concepts:<br />
 _BPM - the rate with which the player must tap the screen.<br />
 _Anomalityes - random dorps/rises of the BPM.<br />
 _Pulse - HP left.                           <br />
Ideas :<br />
 _adding perks like god hand , bionic heart and the lesser blood pump machine<br />
 _implementing a monetary system, like blood drops for example and 1k would form a blood pack ...<br />
 _Statistics to measure progres , to give the sense of progress
 _Custom level or a Campain? which would make the BPM vary and the pacient change appearance.<br />
