A game about beating the heart.
Basic Concepts:
 _BPM - the rate with which the player must tap the screen .
 _Anomalityes - random dorps/rises of the BPM.
 _Pulse - HP left.                                  _ 
Ideas :
 _adding perks like god hand , bionic heart and the lesser blood pump machine
 _implementing a monetary system, like blood drops for example and 1k would form a blood pack ...
 _Statistics to measure progres , to give the sense of progress
 _Custom level or a Campain? which would make the BPM vary and the pacient change appearance.
